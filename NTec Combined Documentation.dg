 **************************************************************/

/*
Overview:
NTec Back-End is a modular, AI-driven auto tuning system that 
integrates advanced calibration techniques with real-time sensor 
feedback. It manages engine calibration maps and applies dynamic 
tuning adjustments based on sensor inputs and AI-based gradient 
optimization. 

Key Functionalities:
1. Base Map Loading:
   - Manages engine calibration maps by parsing and loading 
     predefined engine data into memory.
   - Serves as the baseline configuration for further tuning operations.

2. Gradient Tuning:
   - Uses AI recommendations (likely employing gradient descent 
     or similar optimization algorithms) to gradually adjust 
     calibration parameters.
   - Adapts the engine’s performance parameters continuously based 
     on real-time sensor feedback.

3. Detuning on Part Degradation:
   - Implements safety protocols by reducing tuning parameters when 
     sensor data indicates mechanical degradation.
   - Ensures long-term reliability by preventing engine damage under 
     degraded conditions.

4. Active Aerodynamic Control:
   - Manages aerodynamic components (e.g., Drag Reduction System (DRS) 
     and braking stability) using live sensor data.
   - Optimizes performance during dynamic, high-speed maneuvers.

5. Active Lambda Control:
   - Continuously adjusts the lambda target to maintain an optimal 
     air–fuel ratio.
   - Ensures stoichiometric combustion, crucial for performance and 
     emissions control.

System Architecture:
- Modular Design: Each component operates independently and is 
  configurable via YAML files (e.g., configs/base_map.yaml, 
  configs/tuning_config.yaml).
- Real-Time Sensor Feedback: Processes sensor data continuously to 
  ensure immediate tuning adjustments.
- AI Integration: Incorporates machine learning techniques for 
  predictive tuning, enhancing engine performance under dynamic 
  conditions.
- Safety and Reliability: Integrates detuning mechanisms to adapt 
  to part degradation, emphasizing operational longevity.

Setup and Deployment:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
       pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Configure the system via YAML files.
4. Launch the system:
       python -m src.main


/**************************************************************
 * Section 2: NTec Web (Front-End)
 **************************************************************/

/*
Overview:
NTec Web is the interactive front-end interface for the NTec auto 
tuning system. It provides a user-friendly, web-based interface that 
integrates live sensor data, advanced AI decision-making, and real-time 
controls, enabling both automated and manual tuning adjustments.

Key Features:
1. Real Sensor Integration:
   - Retrieves live sensor data from a CAN bus (or simulates data 
     when hardware is unavailable).
   - Ensures that tuning adjustments reflect the actual engine state.

2. Advanced AI Decision-Making:
   - Employs a TensorFlow model to predict optimal tuning adjustments 
     based on sensor inputs.
   - Supports both automatic tuning recommendations and manual overrides.

3. Interactive Front-End Controls:
   - Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide dynamic dashboards, 
     real-time charts, and control panels.
   - Allows operators to monitor live data, adjust parameters, and 
     oversee system operations.

4. Calibration Map Persistence:
   - Uses YAML files to store and retrieve calibration maps, ensuring that 
     tuning parameters persist across sessions.
   - Facilitates easy configuration and iterative testing without modifying 
     core code.

5. Deployment and Quick Start:
   - Provides an automation script (quick_start.sh) to streamline setup, 
     dependency installation, and application launch.

System Architecture:
- Modular and Extendable: The front-end is developed as an independent 
  module, facilitating parallel updates and future enhancements.
- Real-Time Data Pipeline: Sensor data flows continuously into the AI 
  model, and adjustments are reflected in the UI in real time.
- AI and Machine Learning Integration: Leverages TensorFlow for data-driven 
  decision-making, enhancing responsiveness under variable conditions.
- User-Centric Design: Combines automated tuning with manual control, 
  offering flexibility and oversight in high-performance environments.
- Technology Stack: Utilizes Python for back-end processing and AI integration, 
  alongside standard web technologies (HTML, JavaScript, CSS) for the front-end.

Quick Start Instructions:
1. Run the quick start script:
       ./quick_start.sh
2. The interface launches, providing live updates and interactive control 
   over the tuning process.
